/* 
 * 
 * Rehearsal Scheduler is an application intended to assist in creating a rehearsal schedule 
 * for a theatrical production. Using information from a French scene breakdown for any 
 * given musical, a director can enter student/cast information and retrieve cast, 
 * character, or scene information from a selected musical. Current features include cast 
 * information, scene information, and part (character) information. Future implementation 
 * of scheduling conflicts (to be entered by the student prior to and after the calendar 
 * is made) and a SCHEDULE CALENDAR button that schedules three months of rehearsals at 
 * the press of a button are planned. I hope to incorporate a scheduling system similar 
 * to whenisgood.net with a grid students can use to block off times that they are 
 * unavailable for rehearsal. I then want the program to be able to search their 
 * conflicts with set rehearsal times and plot a rehearsal schedule that minimizes 
 * student conflicts. In the meantime, students can search by their own cast information 
 * to see what scenes they appear in and what parts they have or have had in previous years. 
 * They can update their own phone numbers and whether their costume is complete. They can 
 * see at a glance what page in the script a scene begins, and they have the names of the 
 * songs and scenes for quick reference. I have big dreams for this project.
